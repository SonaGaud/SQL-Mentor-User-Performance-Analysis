-- SQL Mentor User Performance Analysis
-- --------------------------------------
-- This script analyzes user performance based on their SQL submissions.
-- It includes various queries to extract insights such as user rankings, submission counts, and daily performance.

-- Table Creation --

    from daily_submissions
)
select daily, username, correct_submissions   
from users_rank where rank <= 3;

-- Q7. Find The Top 5 Users With The Highest Number Of Incorrect & Correct Submissions.
-- Learning: Identifies users who may need additional support.
-- Function Used: SUM() - Counts incorrect submissions.

-- Q9. Find The User With The Highest Total Points Earned.
-- Learning: Identifies the highest overall performer in terms of points accumulated.
-- Function Used: SUM() - Calculates total points earned by each user.
select username, sum(points) as total_points 
from user_submissions 
group by username order by total_points desc limit 1;

-- Q10. Find The Day With The Highest Number Of Submissions.

    from submission_dates
)

select username, count(*) as longest_streak from streaks
where is_consecutive group by username order by longest_streak desc limit 1;

--Q12. Find Users Who Have Never Submitted An Incorrect Answer.
-- Learning: This query identifies users who have never received negative points, indicating high accuracy and careful submission.
